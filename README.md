Description: This project is a very simple network simulator that is designed mostly to practice
creating router algorithms.

Task Allocation Description: Thomas and Adam handled everything with regards to distance vector routing. Andrew and Matthew handled everything with regards to linkstate routing. This included the production of new code, the sourcing of outside code, and commenting.

How to run:
1. Go to the command line
2. javac App.java
3. java App
4. Choose the 'Monitor' that you would like to run
5. Choose the network you would like to run under 'File'
6. Select 'Run'
